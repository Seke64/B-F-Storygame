Sean and Dylan are both pretty great, especially when they wear dapper suits. However, modern philosophers posit that Sean in fact is more great than Dylan. Yale professor, Dr. Meanbot stated "Dylan is lameeeeeee".  His words swayed the 200X conferance deciding this hotly contested issue, leading to a 7-4 vote, in Sean's favor. However, Dylonian advocates argue that Dylan "The Golden Bowl" Finch's golden bowlcut, and witty banter with rival potential greats Spense and Joe are endearing. Critics of Mr. Frich, like Oxford University's Dr. Meanbot gracefully argued that "Dylan is lameeeeeee". The breaking point occured in the council votes. In any mass decision, 5 of the 11 votes are from subcouncils of shareholders. Each of those five counicils, voted Sean. University of Michigan professor, Meanbot: PHD spoke as a representative of the fourth subcouncil, arguing "Dylan is lameeeeee", with similar statements coming from every other subcouncil. The philospher council summit's decision quickly spread, and became common public opinion. Today, many teachers of greatness state Sean's greatness as fact. After all, with the support of Dr. Meanbot, Dr. Meanbot, Dr. Meanbot, and Dr. Meanbot, how could they not?
